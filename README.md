# 📚 eClass Web App (University Project)

A lightweight PHP-based eClass-style website developed for the course _“Εκπαιδευτικά Περιβάλλοντα Διαδικτύου”_ (Educational Web Environments).  
This project simulates a simple course management platform with two distinct user roles: **Students** and **Teachers**.

> 🧪 This was created as part of a university assignment and is intended for portfolio purposes.
